      July 2023 - Present
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Working on research projects related to deep learning applications in computer vision and natural language processing.</li>
      <li>Collaborating with a team of researchers and engineers to develop cutting-edge solutions for real-world problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Scientist Internship - Pixis</h3>
    <p>
      July 2022 - October 2022
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked on 2 major projects - Targeting AI and Video Generation.</li>
      <li>Used modern ML methods to find look-alikes in a 5M row dataset that helps clients target their ads to people who belong to a particular user persona. (Pandas, Tableau, AWS, Sci-kit learn).</li>
      <li>Designed and Developed a GAN architecture to generate environment maps from text queries that can be used to synthesize videos based on text command. (PyTorch, OpenCV, Albumentations, ProGAN).</li>

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <h3>Development of Reliable, Low Complexity Models for Retinopathy</h3>
    <p>
      IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2023 - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02310">[published]</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a method for iterative knowledge distillation in deep neural network models for retinopathy, resulting in simpler models (~100x smaller) with comparable predictive accuracy and improved reliability as a result of calibration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Inspection of Mechanical components using visual imaging and Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>
      International Conference on Processing and Characterization of Materials 2023 - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785322064896">[published]</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed and Designed a Computer Vision pipeline that is capable of classifying images based on if it has defected parts or not, and also used the Grad-CAM algorithm to localize the defect.</li>
      <li>The end product was a system that can categorize and localize defects in images with training data that only helps classify images.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation of State-of-the-art Computer Vision Architectures</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/04RR/subpixel">[Code]</a> - <a href="https://github.com/04RR/SOTA-Vision">[Code]</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Various novel model architectures used in Computer Vision were implemented along with an open-source library (lightweight PyTorch wrapper) to train Computer Vision Models on custom datasets with less than 5 lines of code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monocular Depth Estimation with Self-Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/04RR/SAFENet-Pytorch">[Code]</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented SAFENet paper that uses Self-Supervised Deep Learning methods to predict the depth of objects in 2-D Monocular images.</li>
    </ul>
